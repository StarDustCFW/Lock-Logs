* This stops sending telemetry to Nintendo

## Reason
* kill telemetry service to avoid get banned with cfw


## Disclaimer
* After a long time of testing, a console that did not send that telemetry is harder to ban than other consoles that did
* * Even so, the risk of ban exists so I recommend using emunand, if you don't want to take that risk
* This is a test, one thing is for sure, it stop the send telemetry through BCAT(PlayReport)
* It is not likely to happen but in case of instability in the system it can be uninstalled by Pressing + - inside the app or deleting from 'System:/save'
80000000000000A1 and 80000000000000A2 saves

### Note:
Tested on:
* 9.1.0 - 10.0.2
* * For use this mod you need update to the latest version required by Nintendo
* This modification will remain installed and will not be deleted until you decide to remove it
#### It will only be removed if:
- - Uninstall it from the app
- - Remove the saves 80000000000000A1 and 80000000000000A2
- - Restoring a nand backup
